# Simple-4-part-platformer

The 4 part platformer is made in pygame. Each part ends up with a runnable example.

There is one incomplete program made with the Arcade library as an example for it.

Added a level editor, in which you can create your own levels that can then be loaded into the dev testing version of
the platformer.
